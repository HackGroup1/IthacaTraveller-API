# Extra things

## Images
We store images in server directories.
We have two kinds of images: 
- User profile images (stored under ~/images/users/)
- Post images (stored under ~/images/posts/)
We restrict each post to have at most one image, and restrict each user to have exactly one profile image. In this way, we can use user_id to name the user profile images and use post_id to name the post images.

### Corresponding APIs:
- GET post image by post_id
  - /api/images/posts/<int:post_id>/
- GET user profile image by user_id
  - /api/images/user/<int:user_id>/
- POST post image by post_id

- POST user profile image by user_id

- DELETE post image by post_id
  - /api/images/post/<int:post_id>/
- DELETE user profile image by user_id
